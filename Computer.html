                <h2>A Tour inside a computer</h2>
                <p>We are looking at what you will see inside a computer when you open, however, there are alot of operating systems to choose from, so we will be taking a look at the famous <strong>Windows 10 OS.</strong></p>
            </section>
            <article id="desktop">
                <h3>The Desktop</h3>
                <a href="./Desktop.png" target="_blank"><img src="./Desktop.png" alt="The Desktop of Windows 10" width="480px" height="270"/></a>
                <p>This is what you will be seeing when you first open your computer assuming you have Windows 10. <br/>
                    This icons at left and a few at the right are not what you will be seeing unless you installed them and choose them to.</p>

                <section id="the storage">
                    <h3>The Storage</h3>
                    <a href="./PC's Storage.png" target="_blank"><img src="./PC's Storage.png" alt="A windows where it shows all its drives" width="480px" height="270"/></a>
                    <p>Here we have a view of the computer's storage. <br/>
                       To view this, search for "<em>This PC</em>" in the Start Menu or simply double click on the "<em>This PC</em>" at the desktop. <br/>
                       As you can see, there are two drives called "<strong><a href="#windows">Windows (C:)</a></strong>" and "<strong><a href="#data">Data (D:)</a></strong>". Do not pay too much attention about their names <br/>
                       since you can rename them as you like. The storage gives you details of all the storage drives in your computer. <br/>
                       <br/>
                       The details include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Full Capacity of each drives</em></li>
                        <li><em>Used space of each drives</em></li>
                        <li><em>Remaining space of each drives</em></li>
                        <li><em>The Device Type</em></li>
                        <li><em>The File Sytem of the drives</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="windows">
                    <h4>Windows (C:)</h4>
                    <a href="OS C.png" target="_blank"><img src="./OS C.png" alt="The files contained in the windows drive" width="480px" height="270"/></a>
                    <p>The Windows (C:) contains various numbers of folder which are actually created by system when you install Windows 10. <br/>
                       Of course, you can add new files and folders in it as you wish. <br/>
                       <br/>
                       The folders usually created by the system are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>$SysReset (Hidden File)</em></li>
                        <li><em>$WinREAgent (Hidden File)</em></li>
                        <li><em>MSOCache (Hidden File)</em></li>
                        <li><em>PerfLogs</em></li>
                        <li><em>Program Files</em></li>
                        <li><em>Program Files (x86)</em></li>
                        <li><em>Program Data (Hidden File)</em></li>
                        <li><em>Temp</em></li>
                        <li><em>Users</em></li>
                        <li><em>Windows</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The following files mentioned above are system files and should <strong>not be modified</strong> unless, <br/>
                       you know what you are doing, or else it might damage or compromise  the operating system. <br/>
                       Unlike the "Data (D:)" drive, "Windows (C:)" drive is much more sensitive and dangerous to mess around. <br/>

                </section>
                <section id="data">
                    <h4>Data (D:)</h4>
                    <a href="./Data D.png" target="_blank"><img src="./Data D.png" alt="The files contained in the data drive" width="480px" height="270"/></a>
                    <p>Data (D:) is pretty much empty without touching it. Its a drive for you to store as you desire such as <br/>
                       games, music, videos, images and infinity as long as the disk space is not full obviously. <br/>
                       I recommend you store files in "Data (D:)" rather than "Windows (C:)" to be <strong>safer.</strong> <br/>
